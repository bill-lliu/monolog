As of right now, in order to set up the full process, you will need to run each of the following in order:

in directory ```emotion_server```, run ```python server.py```

in directory ```computer_vision\src```, run ```python emotions.py --mode display```

in directory ```speech-to-text```, run ```python SpeechToText.py```

in directory ```frontend\material-dashboard-react-master```, run ```npm install```, then ```npm start```



If the dependancies do not install correctly, you will need to ```pip install _name_of_dependancy_``` or ```npm install _name_of_dependancy_```.
